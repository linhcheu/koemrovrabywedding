# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **FIXED: Form Reset Error**

**Problem:** 
```
null is not an object (evaluating 'e.currentTarget.reset')
```

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Changed from uncontrolled to controlled form inputs
- ✅ Using React state to manage form values
- ✅ Form resets using `setFormData({ name: '', message: '' })`
- ✅ No more form.reset() errors!

## 🔧 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### 1. **Comments Not Loading**
**Symptoms:** Loading state shows forever, no comments appear
**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials
- Ensure database table `wedding_wishes` exists
- Check Supabase dashboard for any issues

### 2. **Can't Submit Comments**
**Symptoms:** Button shows "Sending..." forever, error alerts appear
**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Supabase project is active (not paused)
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Ensure RLS policies are correctly set up

### 3. **Environment Variables Not Working**
**Symptoms:** NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is undefined errors
**Solutions:**
- Restart development server after changing `.env.local`
- Ensure variable names start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Check there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- For Vercel deployment, add variables in Vercel dashboard

### 4. **Comments Don't Appear for Other Users**
**Symptoms:** Each user only sees their own comments
**Solutions:**
- This was the old localStorage behavior
- With Supabase, all users should see all comments
- Check if RLS policies allow public read access
- Verify the `wedding_wishes` table has correct permissions

### 5. **Supabase Errors**
**Common Error Messages:**
- `relation "wedding_wishes" does not exist` → Run the SQL schema
- `permission denied` → Check RLS policies
- `Invalid API key` → Verify environment variables
- `Project not found` → Check project URL is correct

## 🎯 **Quick Test Steps:**

1. **Test Database Connection:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
   // Should show your Supabase URL
   ```

2. **Test Comment Submission:**
   - Fill out form with test data
   - Click "Send Wishes"
   - Should show success alert
   - Comment should appear immediately
   - Refresh page - comment should still be there

3. **Test Multiple Users:**
   - Open site in incognito/private window
   - Submit a comment from both windows
   - Both comments should be visible in both windows

## 📱 **Testing Checklist:**
- ✅ Comments load on page refresh
- ✅ New comments appear instantly
- ✅ Form clears after successful submission
- ✅ Loading states work properly
- ✅ Error handling works (try disconnecting internet)
- ✅ Works on mobile devices
- ✅ Works in different browsers

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

1. Check browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
2. Check Supabase dashboard logs
3. Verify all setup steps in `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Try creating a new test comment in Supabase dashboard manually
5. Ensure your Supabase project is in the same region for best performance
